# LGAlertSheet
This project is the source code of a customized AlertView and ActionSheet.

Four kinds of AlertViews are implemented:
1. Normal AlertView with title, message and button(s);
2. AlertView with an image on the top;
3. AlertView with a TextField in it;
4. AlertView showing a progress view and optionally transitioning to completion state.

Two kinds of ActionSheet are implemented: ActionSheet with 1 option and with 2 options.

LGAlertSheet pretty much covers most of the usage scenarios and, moreover:
1. Easy to customize UI as it is implemented using xib and Autolayout.
2. Fully optimized for device rotation and keyboard.
3. Support extensions.
4. Support multiple instances of AlertView/ActionSheet showing one above another.

## Demo

## Usage
1. Showing a plain alert view:
```
    [LGAlertView showAlertWithTitle:@"This is title"
                            message:@"This is message"
                  cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                   otherButtonTitle:@"OK"
                  cancelButtonBlock:nil
                   otherButtonBlock:^(LGAlertView *alertView) {
                       [alertView dismiss];
                   }];
```
Note that to dismiss the AlertView when the "OK" button is clicked, you have to manually call `dismiss` so that you can do something else of the alert like showing wrong message which we'll demostrate later.

2. Showing an AlertView with an image on the top:
```
    [LGAlertView showAlertWithTitleImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"import_done"]
                                   title:@"This is title"
                                 message:@"This is message"
                       cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                        otherButtonTitle:@"OK"
                       cancelButtonBlock:nil
                        otherButtonBlock:nil];
```

3. Showing AlertView with a TextField:
```
    [LGAlertView showAlertWithTitle:@"This is Title"
                            message:@"This is message"
                  cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                   otherButtonTitle:@"OK"
                  cancelButtonBlock:nil
                     textFieldBlock:^(LGAlertView *alertView) {
                         [alertView showErrorMessage:@"Wrong Password" animated:YES];
                     }];
}
```
Here you can show some error message if user's input is not valid with optionally a spring animation.

4. Showing AlertView with a progress view:
```
    LGAlertView *alertView = [LGAlertView alertWithInProgressImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"import_in_progress"]
                                                   completionImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"import_done"]
                                                           message:@"This is a long long long long long long message"
                                                 cancelButtonTitle:@"OK, I know"
                                                  otherButtonTitle:@"Please don't"
                                                 cancelButtonBlock:nil
                                                  otherButtonBlock:nil];
    
    [alertView show];
```
You can call `[alertView animateToCompletionState];` if the progress is completed, or set `alertView.progressView`'s `animationCompletionCallBack` and in that block call `[alertView animateToCompletionState];` so that it will animate to completion state once the progress is completed.

5. Showing ActionSheet with 1 options:
```
    [LGActionSheet showActionSheetWithCancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                                       otherButtonTitle:@"OK"
                                      cancelButtonBlock:nil
                                       otherButtonBlock:nil
                                               fromView:nil];
```
If you pass nil to `fromView`, the super view of ActionSheet is the topmost window. But CAUTION: This parameter MUST NOT be nil in extensions ss we cannot us UIWindow in extensions.
6. Showing ActionSheet with 2 options:
```
    [LGActionSheet showActionSheetWithCancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
                                      otherButtonTitle0:@"Option 1"
                                      otherButtonTitle1:@"Option 2"
                                      cancelButtonBlock:nil
                                      otherButtonBlock0:nil
                                      otherButtonBlock1:nil
                                               fromView:nil];
```

### Extensions
To use LGAlertSheet in extensions, you have to: 
1. Define Macro LGAS_APP_EXTENSIONS
2. Either passing a non-nullable superView parameter to init... method (LGActionSheet) or setting superView before showing the AlertView/ActionSheet.
